# Arkashin
This is the code I used to analyze the microbes found in Arkashin Schurf, Uzon Caldera, Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia

## Description
This is the first time I am trying to provide all the code I used/wrote for a manuscript. I used The *Jupyter Notebook* for this and ran most of the analysis in terminal or directly through ipython notebook.

Please find the code in my gist.
